<h3>Instructor</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.unr.edu/nvcfwru/folt-brian">Dr. Brian Folt</a>
(he/him)<br> Office: Knudsten Resource Center, Room 100A<br> Email: <a
href="bfolt@unr.edu">bfolt@unr.edu</a></p>
<p>I have no pre-scheduled office hours for this class; instead, please
email me to set up a meeting. In general, I will be in my office during
working hours from ca. 8AM–5PM and can be available to discuss course
material.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-meeting-times" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Meeting Times</h3>
<p><strong>Lecture</strong>: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:30–2:45pm, EJCH
202 (Edmund J Cain Hall)</p>

</div>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>In this course, students will learn basic principles of statistical
inference and will gain experience applying these principles to their
research questions using the open-source statistical program <a
href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> with <a
href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">RStudio</a>. We will
focus on concepts and implementation and in general will leave the
nitty-gritty statistics details to other, more focused statistics
classes.</p>
</div>
<div id="student-learning-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Student Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand and apply the linear regression model to perform various
statistical tests (e.g., linear regression, t-tests, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and
general multi-variable models).</li>
<li>How to clearly communicate results from statistical tests.</li>
<li>Understand and communicate assumptions associated with classic
statistical models, and the consequences of assumption violation.</li>
<li>Practical approaches to model selection.</li>
<li>Practical approaches to import data, visualize patterns, interpret
plots, and perform statistical tests using R.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level3">
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Curious scientific mind, broad research interests, and readiness to
engage with data, equations, and computer programming. Students are
expected to have a basic understanding of standard statistical concepts
and methods, obtained through other coursework. If this is not the case,
they should be prepared to work hard to develop the necessary
prerequisite knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Materials</h3>
<p>We will use the course website and a WebCampus page set up for the
course. Most course content (lecture materials) will be made available
on the course website. The course website will be updated frequently to
include lecture materials after they are presented in class and other
material actively being developed for class. Occasional course readings
will be available on the course website. The Discussion Board feature is
available in WebCampus as a forum for discussion, Q&amp;A, and mutual
support in engaging with course materials outside of regular class
meetings.</p>
<p>Readings will be provided on the course website; the papers should be
read prior to the class date indicated in the schedule.</p>
<p>Students will use the open-source statistical program R to perform
analyses. <strong>All students should bring laptops to each
class</strong>, as much of class time will be devoted to hands-on
learning in R.</p>
<p>There are many good books about R, but ultimately, most material can
be found for free online. For the beginner in statistics or R, I
recommend the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Discovering Statistics using R (Andy Field and Jeremy Miles)</li>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for data science (version 2)</a>
(Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund). This
book is available for free online at the website linked here.</li>
<li>Introductory R: a beginner’s guide to data visualization,
statistical analysis, and programming in R (Robert Knell)</li>
<li><a href="https://r-graphics.org/">R Graphics Cookbook</a> (Winston
Chang). This book is available for free online.</li>
<li>Qian, Song S. Environmental and Ecological Statistics with R, Second
Edition, 2nd Edition. Chapman &amp; Hall, 2017.</li>
<li>A Primer of Ecological Statistics. (Nicholas Gotelli and Aaron
Ellison). <em>A stats book, but not an R book.</em></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="course-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Structure</h3>
<p>Instruction will consist of lessons on general statistical concepts
and specific methods commonly used to address questions in ecology and
environmental science. Stats lessons will include lecture-style
materials, readings, demonstrations, exercises and class
discussions.</p>
<p>A large portion of the overall grade (60%) will be based upon
periodic, relatively brief homework assignments
(‘<strong>Exercises</strong>’; <em>n</em> = 8) that follow from the
topics covered in class. Most exercise assignments will involve
statistical analysis and interpretation of sample data sets that are
provided. We will use classtime for students to work on the Exercises on
their computers, either individually or in small groups (2-3 people).
You can show me the results of your Exercises and I will give you credit
for completing the assignment. If you are unable to finish the
assignment during class or are unable to make class during an Exercise
day, you have one week to complete and submit the assignment via
WebCampus/email (TBD). More specific instructions will come during the
semester and I will update this here for clarity.</p>
<p>There will be periodic <strong>Quizzes</strong> (<em>n</em> = 6)
throughout the semester that will comprise 20% of the grade and which
will be administered through WebCampus. Quiz due dates are indicated on
the course schedule.</p>
<p>Students will be graded on <strong>Participation</strong> (20%). As
this is a graduate-level class, engagement and participation during
class, discussions, exercise labs, and other course-related
opportunities is expected and students will be given a grade on their
participation.</p>
<p>Last, an extra-credit opportunity is available to students by
participating in ‘<a
href="https://guides.library.unr.edu/StatsChats">StatsChats</a>’.
StatsChats is an informal weekly gathering to discuss any quantitative
questions you may have related to your research (statistics,
experimental design, model simulation, analysis, debugging R code,
etc.). This is open to any students and faculty that want to improve
their their quantitative skills and/or share their knowledge and
experience. StatsChats will be weekly on Tuesdays (starting September 3)
from 12-1PM in the Lilli Brant reading room in the DeLaMare Science and
Engineering Library (third floor). Students will gain
<strong>+10%</strong> credit to their overall class grade <strong>if
they attend four (4) out of the ten total StatsChats sessions during the
semester</strong>.</p>
<p>There will be no <strong>final exam</strong> for the class.</p>

appropriate accommodations.</p>
</div>
<div id="statement-on-academic-dishonesty" class="section level3">
<h3>Statement on Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>Cheating, plagiarism, or otherwise obtaining grades under false
pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this
university. Plagiarism is using the ideas or words of another person
without giving credit to the original source; this includes copying
another student in class. Always cite the source of your information.
This includes copying or paraphrasing from a book, journal, or
unpublished material without giving credit to the author(s), and
submitting a term paper that was used in another course. Academic
dishonesty will not be tolerated and penalties can include filing a
final grade of “F”; reducing the student’s final course grade one or two
full grade points; awarding a failing mark on the coursework in
question; or requiring the student to retake or resubmit the coursework.

<div id="use-of-generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-assignments"
class="section level3">
<h3>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Assignments</h3>
<p>This course assumes that all work submitted by students – which
includes all process work, drafts, brainstorming artifacts, final works
– will be generated by the students themselves, working individually or
in groups as directed by course assignment instructions. This policy
indicates the following constitute violations of academic honesty and
“cheating”: any unauthorized use of generative AI tools (such as
ChatGPT), as outlined in UNR Academic Integrity Policy (UAM 6,502).</p>
<p>Some assignments may allow for the use of the authorized use of such
tools, but will be expressly described in the assignment instructions.
For the purposes of those assignments, specific instructions will be
provided on the use of generative AI tools regarding the type of work
being allowed (i.e. brainstorming, drafts, final works, etc.). Please
email the instructor for any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>Generative AI tools have become extremely accessible and, in certain
instances, can be useful for data analysis. However, I believe it is
important that the students in this class develop a deep, foundational
understanding of the concepts covered here. To fully benefit from the
course, I strongly encourage you to complete all assignments without
relying on AI-generated solutions. This will not only help you grasp the
material more effectively, but also ensure that you can confidently
apply these techniques in real-world scenarios (e.g., your graduate
thesis or dissertation) without external assistance. Mastering these
skills now will provide you with a solid foundation for your graduate
research and your future career as a scientist or practitioner. I
promise that the course content will not be so overwhelming as to
require external help from generative AI. We may explore using AI to
assist with coding toward the end of the semester.</p>

<div id="statement-on-audio-and-video-recording" class="section level3">
<h3>Statement on Audio and Video Recording</h3>
<p>Surreptitious or covert video-taping of class or unauthorized audio
recording of class is prohibited by law and by Board of Regents policy.
This class may be videotaped or audio recorded only with the written
permission of the instructor. In order to accommodate students with
disabilities, some students may have been given permission to record
class lectures and discussions. Therefore, students should understand
that their comments during class may be recorded.</p>
